CEWS (Corporate Employee Welfare System)
The software is made using JSP, HTML, CSS, MySql and hosted on Apache server. Software is similar to Facebook, where employees of a corporate company working at different locations can collaborate on issues they face in day today working. They can help each other on office work problems. At one end, it gives employees platform to collaborate on useful issues and on the other hand it provides feedback to employers through those employees who are resigning/leaving the company, thus making it useful for both the employees and employers.
